# Ameex.Umbraco.Forms.Integrations.Crm.Salesforce

This repository houses open-source extensions, created for Umbraco CMS, that integrate with third-party platforms.

In order to connect your Umbraco forms with Salesforce, you should create the Connected App in the Salesforce console and get the client Id and client secret from the app.

## Available Integrations

[Salesforcw](./src/Ameex.Umbraco.Forms.Integrations.Crm.Salesforce/) - a custom workflow allowing form form entries to be mapped to a salesforce lead record, and stored within the CRM platform.
